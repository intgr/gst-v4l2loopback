v4l2loopback - gstreamer sink to write into v4l2 loopback devices
=================================================================

--- PREREQUISITES ---
you need a linux-kernel that has v4l2 support (anything >=2.6.0).

then you need the v4l2loopback kernel driver installed; get it from:
http://code.google.com/p/v4l2loopback/

and then you need gstreamer-0.10

--- INSTALL ---
you need autotools, a C-compiler (preferably gcc), gstreamer-headers and the
v4l2-headers (the latter should be available on any recent linux installation)

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ make
  $ make install

see the INSTALL file for more detailed instructions

--- RUN ---

once installed, there is a new gstreamer element called "v4l2loopback";
you can inspect it using:
$  gst-inspect v4l2loopback

a simple pipeline using v4l2loopback would be:
$ gst-launch videotestsrc ! ffmpegcolorspace ! v4l2loopback

--- NOTES ---
the framesize is negotiated at runtime; virtually any framesize should be
possible

the colorspace is currently fixed to YUY2 (aka YUYV); LATER this might be
negotiated via caps as well...
